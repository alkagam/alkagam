Hi there 👋
About Me
I’m a passionate Computer Engineering student with a strong foundation in full-stack development, ranging from frontend design to backend logic and database management. I also have experience in embedded systems, using microcontrollers like Arduino and simulation tools like Proteus and FPGA.

Recognized for my self-learning ability, problem-solving mindset, and interest in bridging the gap between software and hardware. I'm highly motivated by continuous learning, multidisciplinary collaboration, and building real-world tech solutions that make an impact.

I'm currently...
🔭 Working on:

Web-based applications for text analysis and visualization (e.g., entropy analyzers).

Simulations of embedded systems using microcontrollers and digital control logic.

🌱 Learning:

Advanced SQL optimization

Cloud computing basics

Microservices architecture and distributed systems

👯 Looking to collaborate on:

Web or embedded projects focused on data analysis, UX, or IoT.

Educational tools or apps with social/academic impact.

🤔 Looking for help with:

Scaling backend performance

Optimizing SQL queries and database schema for large datasets
